My attemp to save Christmast.

*If you don't know what is this about go to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).
I don't have any right on the puzzles, only to the solutions).*

Each puzzle will be solved in a file named ``dd-p.py`` where *dd* is two digit day and
p is puzzle number (1-2).

The input data will be saved in input/ with the same name format with the correspondin extension (most probably .txt).

2 days late, but half sunday to make for it!

## day 1 - puzzle 1

Who let the junnior do the job?

This could be solved by regex, I will let that as a last resort.

Only comment, read the problem to the end instead of half guessing the question.
